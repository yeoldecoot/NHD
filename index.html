  <h1>Nicola Tesla</h1>
  
  <h2>Teslas early life</h2>
  
  <p>Nicola tesla was born in 1856 in Lika where he lived with his father mulitan, his mother Djuka. At a young age Tesla was exposed to his fathers emmense library where he gained all his knowledge but the inventive part of him came from his mother with her always making appliences to help around the house. at the age of 17 he went to a ploytechnic school where he then studied mechanical and electrical enginnering. His first real invention was made when he was 24 and reciting poetry with a friend when he came up with the idea of the induction motor but it was still 6 years before he would first show off his idea. </p>

  <h2>Tesla and his inventions</h2>
  
  <h3>A/C Electricity</h3>
  
  <p>If you own a home chances are that you are using A/C Electricity every single day. A/C Ekectricity is generated by turning a coil in a magnetic feild the coil produces motional emfs and because of the coil is rotating the voltage produced alternate current (see picture below)which is useful for changing voltage using a transformer</p>

  <h3>The Wardenclyffe Tower</h3>
	
  <p>In 1901 Nicola Tesla paid a man named stanford white to build his tower that was said to work quite like the internet works today with that it could transmit information through great distances just by using a tower. Tragedy struck when Tesla relized that he wouldn't have enough money to finish his project. Meanwhile someone else a man named macroni was stealing his ideas but the one differance was that he was getting funded. In December 1901 the first signal from macroni's device was sent from england to newfound land. Though tesla was eventually credited with the invention of the radio. It was long after he had died so the original patent went to macroni who became very rich and tesla still as poor as a bum.</p>
  
  <h3>Tesla coming to americal</h3>
  <p>At the age of 28 Tesla arrived in new york and was terrified at the sight of how behind they were in terms of technology with pole with crooked wires sewn throughout the street, unprotected and very dangerous. one of the only power generation companys was edisons own dc powerstation on pearl street. Tesla made his way down to where edison worked and gave him his letter of reccomendation it read: "My Dear Edison: I know two great men and you are one of them. The other is this young man!" edison knew about A/C electricity but he didn't want to learn more he saw it as a competition. The only similarity between the two were their lack for sleep, aparentley they could go for days without sleep. but when Tesla finished his upgrading of the power plant and asked for his money he turned him down and said:"When you become a full-fledged American you will appreciate an American joke," </p>
